# Supply Chain Analysis Project

## üîç Business Problem
AtliQ Mart, a growing FMCG manufacturer headquartered in Gujarat, India, is operational in three cities: Surat, Ahmedabad, and Vadodara. The company aims to expand to other metro and Tier 1 cities in the next two years. However, a few key customers did not extend their annual contracts due to service issues. The suspected reason is that essential products were either not delivered on time or not delivered in full over a continued period, resulting in poor customer service.

## üåê Overview
The objective of this project is to analyze the supply chain performance of AtliQ Mart by evaluating various supply chain metrics, identifying gaps in service delivery, and providing actionable recommendations to improve customer satisfaction.
